# Pirate Translator

A simple command-line or single-page web toy that takes plain English text and "translates" it into the pirate dialect.

The pirate dialect consists mostly of emphasizing "R", replacing or abbreviating some words ("hello" => "ahoy"), and inserting colorful idioms like "Avast!" and "Shiver me timbers!" between sentences.
