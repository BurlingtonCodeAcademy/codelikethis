# Cute Fight

Users upload pictures of their pets; other users are shown pairs of pets and asked which one is cuter.

## Tech

* jQuery or React
* HTML forms and layout
* long-term storage, preferably database on server
* login/authentication (to prevent ballot box stuffing)
* file upload

## Design

Think about how to track votes. Potentially every user can vote for every pair of pet pics.

Think about how to present pairs. Will it be a bracket tournament? Randomized pairing? Can you cute-fight yourself?
