# Hangman

Based on an [vintage BASIC game](http://www.vintage-basic.net/games.html)  -- see the source code at [HANGMAN.BAS](https://www.atariarchives.org/basicgames/showpage.php?page=80) (but don't try to understand it; it's very dense).

Create a command-line or single-page web app that plays hangman.
