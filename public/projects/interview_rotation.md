# Interview Rotation

The goal of this project is to give you experience as both the *interviewer* and the *interviewee* in a technical interview.

## Steps

1. Watch the [Google Technical Interview Video](https://youtu.be/XKu_SEDAykw) and discuss
2. Pair up.
3. Each pair should pick **one** of the following "Rosetta Code" interview questions.
  * [Balanced Brackets](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/coding-interview-prep/rosetta-code/balanced-brackets)
  * [General FizzBuzz](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/coding-interview-prep/rosetta-code/general-fizzbuzz/)
  * [ABC Problem](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/coding-interview-prep/rosetta-code/abc-problem/)
  * [24 Game](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/coding-interview-prep/rosetta-code/24-game/)
  * [100 Doors](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/coding-interview-prep/rosetta-code/100-doors)
4. [30 min] Solve the problem together.
5. When the bell rings, find a new pair partner. **Do not** pick someone who has solved the same problem.
6. [30 min] **Role play!** One person does a [technical interview](https://youtu.be/XKu_SEDAykw) of the other, asking the interviewee to solve a problem that the interviewer has already learned.
7. [30 min] Repeat steps 4 & 5 as time allows.
