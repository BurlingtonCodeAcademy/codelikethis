# Interview Rotation

The goal of this project is to give you experience as both the *interviewer* and the *interviewee* in a technical interview.

## Steps

1. Watch the [Google Technical Interview Video](https://youtu.be/XKu_SEDAykw) and discuss
2. Pair up.
3. Each pair should pick **one** of the following "Rosetta Code" interview questions.
  * [Balanced Brackets](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/coding-interview-prep/rosetta-code/balanced-brackets)
  * [General FizzBuzz](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/coding-interview-prep/rosetta-code/general-fizzbuzz/)
  * [ABC Problem](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/coding-interview-prep/rosetta-code/abc-problem/)
  * [24 Game](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/coding-interview-prep/rosetta-code/24-game/)
  * [100 Doors](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/coding-interview-prep/rosetta-code/100-doors)
4. [30 min] Solve the problem together.
5. When the bell rings, find a new pair partner. **Do not** pick someone who has solved the same problem.
6. [30 min] **Role play!** One person does a [technical interview](https://youtu.be/XKu_SEDAykw) of the other, asking the interviewee to solve a problem that the interviewer has already learned.
7. [30 min] Repeat steps 5 & 6 as time allows. Alternate which role you play so you get experience as both an interviewer and an interviewee.

## Sample Schedule

| time | activity |
|---|---|
| 9:15 am  | watch and discuss the Google Interview video |
| 10:00 am | group up and learn (or review) a particular puzzle |
| 10:30 am | pair up and roleplay an interviewer + interviewee |
| 11:00 am | re-pair and repeat roleplay (swap roles and partners) |
| 11:30 am | re-pair and repeat roleplay |

## Furthermore...

From now until you get a job, you should add "coding interview prep" to your practice. Every week or so, learn a new interview problem, and periodically meet with fellow job-seeking students to role play interviews again.
