# Dothraki Translator

![dothraki](dothraki.jpg)

For the TV show _Game of Thrones_ they [hired a linguist](http://www.vulture.com/2013/04/game-of-thrones-dothraki-language-inventor.html) to create a complete fictional language for the nomadic equestrian Dothraki warrior people.

Creating a full Engligh-to-Dothraki translator is a _little_ too complicated for this class. Fortunately, someone else did it, and made an API for it! 

Check out <http://funtranslations.com/api/dothraki> 

In this project you will make a command-line or web app that accepts user input in English, passes it to the API, parses the response, and displays the translation.

## tech

* AJAX (or node HTTP client)
* JSON (for response parsing)
