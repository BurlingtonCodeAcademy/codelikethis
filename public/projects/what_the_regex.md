# What the /^\re*[ge]+x?$/

In this project you will learn about regular expressions.

A Regular Expression is a program that matches (or fails to match) parts of a string. Regular Expressions are often found inside of other, larger programs, but in this section we'll be learning them independently. As a programming language, regexes are very concise and can be difficult to understand; try to think of it as a cipher or puzzle and have fun learning its arcane rules without worrying too much about what they're used for.
