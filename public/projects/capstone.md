# Capstone Project

During the last four weeks of this course, you'll spend most of your afternoons working on a single project. 

# Step 1: Discovery

Spend this time exploring ideas and building a team. 

Do you have an idea? Discuss it with your fellow students.

Do you want to work with a client (or "project sponsor")? Here are some local projects that could use your help:

* http://www.codeforbtv.org/projects/cvoeo-app - build a mobile app for a non-profit to help several hundred Vermonters per year to manage their money, complete their paperwork, and earn up to $750/year from Financial Futures benefits

* ...

# Step 2: Proposal

Write up a brief (500 words or less) project proposal. Include
  * the team members
  * the business or personal issue the project will solve
  * a rough list of features

Schedule a time to discuss the project with a teacher. We will evaluate it for feasibility, or send it back for more work (or for replacement with a more feasible idea).

If it's acceptable, we'll assign you a coach, who will check in with your team as needed, and attend demos and planning meetings for advice and counsel.

# Step 3: Inception

Schedule a time during the first week in August for a project inception. Invite all team members and stakeholders (the project sponsor if you have one)and your coach. Allow at least 4 hours, intending to come out of the meeting with some rough wireframes, a story grid, a system architecture, and a work plan for each of four weeks. If you need to do more planning, schedule another 2-hour planning meeting for later in the week.

# Step 4: Iteration

During each of the four weeks, schedule the following:

 * Weekly planning meeting
 * Daily standup meeting
 * Weekly retrospective
 * Acceptance meeting / sponsor demo (weekly, or more frequently if possible) -- to get the client to sign off on the features, report bugs, and adjust priorities
 * In-class demo (show and tell!) -- we will set up Friday morning slots during weeks 2 and 3 for you to demo your app to the class; consider this a dress rehearsal for Hiring Partner Demo Day
