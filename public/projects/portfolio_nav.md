# Portfolio Pages with Nav

Now that you've learned about navigation, add some nav to your [portfolio page](portfolio_page)

## Goals


* build several linked HTML pages, e.g.
  * Home
  * About Me
  * Projects (a list of links to your github repos and/or links to your deployed projects, possibly with screenshots or a fancy flexboxy display)
  * Work History (but *not* Case Studies -- wait for the Career Workshop on that)
  * Hobbies
* create a nav bar (consistent UI on each page, with links to the various other pages)
  * style the navbar using Flexbox or another [CSS navbar technique](/lessons/responsive_layout/navigation)
* create a [sitemap.txt](http://www.advancedhtml.co.uk/robots-sitemaps.htm#sitemaps) (for Search Engine use)
  * see http://www.advancedhtml.co.uk/robots-sitemaps.htm#sitemaps for instructions
  * OPTIONAL: submit your site to Google https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home?hl=en and (in a day or two) wait to see your sitemap reflected in the Google search results
  * (the easiest way to verify it is "Alternative Methods - HTML tag")
