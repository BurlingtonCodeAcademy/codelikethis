# GitHub Portfolio Page

## Background

A "Portfolio Page" is a web site that showcases your personal work. It's like a resume that people can click on to see examples -- live and running in-browser if possible! -- of the work in question.

We will use [GitHub Pages]() to build and host your portfolio site.

## Steps

1. Visit <https://pages.github.com/> and follow the steps there to create a "Hello World" site living at <http://yourgithubusername.github.io>
2. Edit the HTML file to list the following information:
  * your name
  * your github username, with a link to your GitHub Repos page e.g. <https://github.com/BurlingtonCodeAcademy> 
  * your public social media accounts, with links, e.g. <https://twitter.com/alexch>
  * (optional) your contact information, e.g. email, phone, Skype id
3. Deploy the changes and demo it to a teacher

Later we will add sections for resume, case studies, class projects, etc.
