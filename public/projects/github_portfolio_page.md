# GitHub Portfolio Page

## Background

A "Portfolio Page" is a web site that showcases your personal work. It's like a resume that people can click on to see examples -- live and running in-browser if possible! -- of the work in question.

We will use [GitHub Pages]() to build and host your portfolio site.

## Steps

1. Visit <https://pages.github.com/> and follow the steps there to create a "Hello World" site living at <http://yourgithubusername.github.io> .
2. Edit the HTML file to list the following information:
  * your name
  * your github username, with a link to your GitHub Repos page e.g. <https://github.com/BurlingtonCodeAcademy> 
  * your public social media accounts, with links, e.g. <https://twitter.com/alexch> -- **only if** you feel comfortable mixing your social media life with your work life
  * if you have a LinkedIn account, link to it too
  * Your current city and state (if you are job-hunting there; otherwise it's not needed). **Don't** list your street address or zip code.
  * (optional) your contact information, e.g. email, phone, Skype id. Consider what information you want to be available when anyone Googles your name.
3. Deploy the changes and demo it to a teacher.

Later we will add sections for resume, case studies, class projects, etc.
