# Introduction to DevOps

* DevOps = Developers + Operations
* term coined in ~2008 by Patrick Debois
* a reaction to overspecialization in large software engineering orgs
* meant to give developers control of their work, while also respecting ops experts and policies

# DevOps High Points



# DevOps is an Agile practice

* based in Agile 

"We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
* Working software over comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
* Responding to change over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more."

# Agile in practice

* automate everything you can
* test everything
* break down all work into small tasks & work on only one task at a time until it's done
* deploy continuously
* keep improving code quality, even after it's shipped
* measure velocity before predicting completion dates
* collaborate, don't delegate
  * pair programming > code review
  * daily 

# Continuous Delivery

* deploy small changes often
* high confidence in deploys, via automated tests
* allow rollback, but prefer rollforward
* *feature flags* allow experimental code to be deployed without compromising existing functionality

# Doctor, it hurts

Here's an old joke with a new punchline.

Patient: "Doctor, it hurts when I do this."

Traditional doctor: "So stop doing it."

Agile doctor: "So do it *again and again*, until it stops hurting."

The Agile doctor's answer only makes sense because as softrware engineers we can automate away the pain.
