# What is an Inception?
* aka Iteration Zero
* an exploratory workshop
* where the whole team
* defines the goals and themes for a project
* and produces an initial backlog
* to kickstart an iterative process
* “Plans are useless, but planning is essential”
* “No plan survives contact with the enemy”

# Inception Goals
*  define the project’s goals, anti-goals, risks, themes
*  produce an initial story backlog
*  produce a rough project timeline

# Optional Inception Goals
* elevator pitch
* initial recurring schedule for team meetings
* write team charter
* sketch technical architecture (but avoid BDOF)
* build paper prototype

# Inception Anti-Goals

*  working software
*
*  others?


# Sample Schedule

￼![sample schedule]()


# Project Goals

*  keep all goals SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant & time-bound)

*  business goals
*  product goals
*  engagement goals
*  team goals
  *    workday experience
  *    explore technology
  *    experiment with processes (e.g. remote pairing)

# Project Non-Goals

  *  things we explicitly do not want included
  *  useful when there’s a priority decision to be made
  *  e.g. if a non-goal is “support mobile” then we can ignore Mobile Safari bugs


# Project Risks

		Business risks (Does the market want this?  Will an emerging technology disrupt this product? 
		Technical risks (Are there 3rd party integrations?  Are there unknown technologies/libraries to learn?  Does the product rely on platforms that are changing, e.g., iOS, Android?)
		Schedule risks (Are there pre-MVP gates to satisfy third-parties, e.g.  developers on another team?  Is there a near term, immovable milestone like a festival launch?)

# Project Themes
*  themes are the threads that tie a product together

# Elevator Pitch

*  mad-libs game

# Personas
*  traditionally: personas map to types of users
*  can also include developers, clients, admins, customer support reps, QA testers, apps, spammers…
*  one persona per card/sheet

# Persona Activities
*  for each persona, ask what they can do (and can’t)
*  one activity per card
*  diagram relationships among personae and activities

# Story Mapping
*  very time-consuming
*  take plenty of breaks! facilitator, don’t rush!
*  goal is to get broad and deep, clustering rather than prioritizing
*  looking for themes, not details
*  but still, try to break down stories into smaller stories

# Epics
*  An Epic is a series of Stories
*  For instance the epic “User Accounts” could include “Sign up, Sign in, Change password, Edit profile, Upload avatar”
  *  (not necessarily in that order, of course)
*  Put epics across the top row, stories in columns underneath their epic

# Advice for Facilitators

  (for Story Mapping but really for any planning or retro game)

*  Stay impartial
*  Try to ask questions, not make statements
*  After asking a question, count to ten! someone else will fill the silence
*  Ask clarifying questions, even if you know the answer
*  If the conversation veers, steer it back to the original topic (or ask for consensus to change topics)
*  	Some teams use a Parking Lot for items to deal with immediately after the meeting — i prefer the title IOU
*  If the conversation ebbs, ask if anyone sees a pattern… or has a suggestion… or if it’s time for a break

# Estimation and Prioritization

* Estimation and Prioritization go hand in hand
  * You shouldn’t prioritize until there’s an estimate, but you shouldn’t estimate until you know it’s near the top of the (unestimated) pile
  * Sometimes unexpectedly high or low estimates will change the priority
* Estimation is a technical task, prioritization is a customer task
  * (except with chores)
  * (and sometimes bugs)

# How to Prioritize?

It’s up to the customer, BUT here are some guidelines:

* - prioritize by business value (higher value first)
* - prioritize by risk (higher risk first)
* - prioritize by effort (easy wins first)
* - prioritize by simplicity (technical merit first, e.g. code quality or UI consistency or system stability)
* - prioritize by cost (but weigh dev hours against cash expenses)

# Recurring Meetings

*  Daily Standup
*  Weekly Iteration Planning (IPM)
*  Acceptance (can be weekly, semi-weekly, ad hoc, or any combination)
  * - problems can be Rejections or new Bugs or Features
  * - be careful not to hastily prioritize or estimate new or split stories (including bugs) — put them in the Icebox or Inbox
  * - Acceptance doesn’t need to include the whole team, but if the right people aren’t in the room, invite them or wait until the next meeting
  * — face-to-face is always better than
*  Retrospectives (weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly)
  * - the more frequent they are, the shorter they can be
  * - good/bad/weird is a common game, but doesn’t need to be the only one
  * - see Agile Retros book
*  Demos (often coincide with Acceptance, but not always)
*  User Testing sessions
* Others?
