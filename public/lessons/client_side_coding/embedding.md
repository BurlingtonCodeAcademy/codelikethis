# Embedding

[Embedding](/lessons/www/embedding_media) is the process of including *media* from other sources into your web sites.

Sometimes you can use JavaScript to interact with the embedded file or app as if it were another User Interface element on your page!

For instance, you could programmatically pause and play an embedded audio clip, say, playing "hoorah!" when the user wins a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

Or, if the user moves their location on an embedded Google Map, your app could be notified and find the city name and look up restaurants in that area on [Yelp's API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3.

# TODO

write up some embedding script slides
