# Testing your Code

Testing is an important part of writting good code. It provides several benefits

* lets us refactor at will without worrying about breaking everything beyond repair.

* helps us think through our code structure

* allows us to make sure reality matches our expectations

* lets others have confidence that our code works as it should

There are two basic types of testing

* Unit testing

* Acceptance testing
