# Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript

# What is an Object?

* an *encapsulation* of *state* with *behavior*

In the server-side lesson we wrote code to 

In this lesson we will introduce Object-Oriented concepts and illustrate them with Test-Guided exercises to come out with a 

# OO Concept: `class`

A *class* is a type.

An *instance* is an individual.

> For example, there are many houses, but my house is yellow.

In JavaScript, the keyword `class` 

# OO Concept: `new`

# OO Concept: `this`

# JS Detail: Fat Arrow and Binding

In most OO languages, the pointer *`this`* (sometimes named *`self`*) is managed automatically. Any time you're executing code inside class A, `this` is guaranteed to point to an instance of that class.

In JavaScript, `this` needs to be managed more actively. 

Specifically, during *callbacks* `this` still points to the *other* object, even inside a callback!

Solution: the `=>` fat arrow *re-binds* `this` to point to the *current* object.

# OO Concept: `constructor`

# OO Concept: `static`

# OO Concept: encapsulation
