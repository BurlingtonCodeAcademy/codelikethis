# How to Demo

1. say what you’re gonna do, then do it, then say what you see
2. don’t multitask: either speak *or* act
3. take your hands off the keyboard when answering a question
3. don’t assume the user can see the cursor
4. make eye contact
5. practice

# Say what you see

"A picture is worth a thousand words..."

... but it's a different thousand words for each viewer!

So try to be clear about describing what you see.

Good: "So after I click the submit button, you'll see a spinny animation for a second... \<click> There it is! \<click> ... and now the next page is loaded."

# Answering Questions

* Repeat the question 
    * or at least acknowledge its claims
* Thank the questioner
* Don't be defensive!
