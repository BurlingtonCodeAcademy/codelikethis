# Lab: Countdown

Given the follwing starter code write a program that counts down from 10, prints the count to the console, and then prints out `"Blastoff!!!"` after the count has completed.
```javascript
let count = 10

while(count > 0) {

  //write your code here

}

console.log('Blastoff!!!')
```

# Countup

Can you change countdown so it counts from 1 to 10 instead?
