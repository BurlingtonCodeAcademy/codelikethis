# Lab: Is Divisable

One number is divisable by another if you divide them and the remainder is 0. Create a new file inside your `code` directory called `divisable.js`. In this file, given this starter code write a program that accepts two numbers and returns `true` if the numbers are evenly divisible, and `false` if they are not.
```javascript
function divisible(numOne, numTwo) {
  //write your code here
  //if numOne is divisible by numTwo return true, else return false

}

divisible(100, 5) // => true
divisible(100, 8) // => false
divisible(330, 11) // => true
divisible(337, 7) // => false
```

> Bonus Challenge: Write this program **without** using any division.
