In computers, code is a series of instructions that tell a computer what to do.

# What is coding?

* coding (aka programming or software development) is a *human* activity
* it's called *code* because what we write is *not* what the computer reads
* to a computer, it's all ones and zeros; to us, it's words (and numerals and punctuation)

# What is coding NOT?

* coding is **not** mathematical
  * some logic
  * mostly just counting
* coding is **not** solitary
  * most coding happens in a team
  * pair programming is awesome
* coding is **not** about finding the right answer
  * there's always more than one way to do it
  * every solution has tradeoffs
  * there is always a better way, and never a perfect way
  * "The only perfect program is an empty file." - Alex
