# Learn To Code

You may have never programmed before. Now you will.

# What is coding?

* coding = programming
* coding is communication
  * between you and a computer
  * between you and other coders

# What is coding NOT?

* coding is not mathematical
  * some logic
  * mostly just long todo lists
* coding is not lonely
  * most coding happens in a team
  * pair programming is awesome
