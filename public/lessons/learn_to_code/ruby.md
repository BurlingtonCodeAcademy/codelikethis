# Ruby

* Ruby was invented in the 1990s by a very nice Japanese man named Yukihiro Matsumoto (nicknamed Matz)
* The motto of Ruby is MINASWAN:

> Matz is nice, and so we are nice.

# Ruby is fun

* Ruby was [designed to be fun](http://blog.crowdint.com/2013/06/11/matz-keynote-at-ruby-kaigi-2013.html) to write code in, while also being powerful and well-rounded.
* *Ruby is poetry*
  * especially compared to other languages
