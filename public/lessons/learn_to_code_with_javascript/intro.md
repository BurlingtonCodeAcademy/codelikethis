# Intro

You may have never programmed before. Now you will.

# What is code?

In general, code is something that stands for something else.

In computers, code is a series of instructions that tell a computer what to do.

# What is coding?

* coding (aka programming or software development) is a *human* activity
* it's called *code* because what we write is *not* what the computer reads
* to a computer, it's all ones and zeros; to us, it's words (and numerals and punctuation)

# What is coding NOT?

* coding is **not** mathematical
  * some logic
  * mostly just long todo lists
* coding is **not** solitary
  * most coding happens in a team
  * pair programming is awesome
* coding is **not** about finding the right answer
  * there's always more than one way to do it
  * every solution has tradeoffs
  * there is always a better way, and never a perfect way
  * "The only perfect program is an empty file." - Alex

# What is coding?

* coding is fun!
* coding is frustrating!
* coding is creative!
* coding is communication
  * between you and a computer
  * between you and other coders
  * between you and future you

# A Program Is Like A Recipe

* a recipe is a collection of *ingredients* and *instructions*

* a program is a collection of *data* and *code*

> When you are writing code, you are not baking cookies, you are writing a recipe for how to make cookies.

# Languages

* every program is written in a LANGUAGE
  * like Java or Python or C or Fortran
  * even HTML and CSS and SQL are languages
  * every computer language has a silly name
* different languages are useful in different areas, but there is a lot of overlap
* today we will learn the JavaScript programming language

# Errors Are Awesome

* Don't be afraid of errors
* Your computer is trying to help you fix your program
  * It's just *really* bad at communicating

> If your code is a two-year-old child, then an error is a temper tantrum.

(It can take effort to figure out the underlying reason why they're upset and fix it.)

* It's not all gibberish
* Try to read it -- really try! -- and pull out the pearls from the pig slop

In this class, you will learn about:

*  The command line and why we use it
*  Strings, Arrays, Variables, Objects, Loops, Files
*  How to run your code interactively or from a file
*  How to make a very simple website run on your own computer
