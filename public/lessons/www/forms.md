# Forms

The `<form>` tag means:

  * when the user enters data into these input elements
  * and clicks the "Submit" button
  * then the browser will wrap up all those values and send it to the server

# Form Example

# Forms are semantic

* a form wraps *input* elements for submission
  * but may also *include* or *be included within* other styled elements
* most of the time your `<form>` element will correspond to a block element (viz. the border of the form) 
  * but by default `<form>` is an *inline* element
  * and instead of making it a block element, it's usually better to wrap it in a `div`
