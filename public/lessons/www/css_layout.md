# Inline vs. Block Level Elements

It is important to recognize there are two main 'displays', for HTML elements.

	* Block level = New line, full width
	* Inline level = Same line, width of content

# Positioning

There are 3 commonly-used position properties in CSS. These further help to position elements on a page. They also help to further confuse you as a developer. 

* Relative - Relative to the flow of the HML document. can be moved around with the properties top, left, right, bottom.
* Absolute - This is positioned relative to its parent (of relative positioning). 
* Fixed - Position an element is relation to its viewport (browser window).
* Static - "not positioned". This is the default value, and is not positioned in any sort of fancy way.
