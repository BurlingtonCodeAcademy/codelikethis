# Hello World! Demo
Let's jump right in! Please feel free to follow along - doing is always better than just watching :)

* Download a text editor. Microsoft WordÂ® is a **word processor**, not a **text editor**. My favorite is Sublime Text, but you have the freedom to choose your own. Feel free to do a quick google for, 'best word processors'.

# Lets write our first HTML document!

* All HTML documents should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration.  This does not require a **closing tag**.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

# Basic HTML Structure

* The most basic HTML structure includes a DOCTYPE declaration, an HTML tag, a head tag, and a body tag. This looks like the following:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```

* Notice how the head and body sections are **nested** in the HTML tags. We will get more into nesting later. The important thing to note here is that HTML does not need to be indented. It is important however, to make your code easier to read for humans. 

# Let's Add Content!

We will now add some text to our first web page! Inside of the ```<body>``` tag, lets add the following text:

* Hello World!
 
# Let's Open Our First Web Page!

* We will now save and open our first web page using a browser :)
